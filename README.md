# Animated scatterplot on Gapminder data
###### This project was completed in Week 1 of the Data Science bootcamp at SPICED Academy.
In this project, I imported and preprocessed data from four Gapminder datasets. First I plotted the data from each year separately and then using imageio library created animated scaterplot.
